00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:02,340
let's

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,620
start.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,100
The

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,420

6
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:06,560

photography

8
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,820
is

9
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,320
more

10
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,480
than

11
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,700
just

12
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,160
documentation.

13
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:09,640
It's

14
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:09,740
a

15
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:09,920

16
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,060

18
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,820
-expression.

19
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,180
It

20
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,380
really

21
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:12,640
has

22
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:12,820
a

23
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,060

24
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:13,320

25
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,780

26
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,300
perceptions

27
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,680
and

28
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:14,920
also

29
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,360
forming

30
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,080
perspectives.

31
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,260
I

32
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,560

you

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,460
you,

know,

156
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:03,180
they

categorize

158
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:03,980
things

159
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,120
from

160
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,360
Africa

161
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:04,500
as

162
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:04,660
being

163
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,000
primitive.

164
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,340
It's

165
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,500
not

166
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:05,820
primitive.

167
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,400
It's

168
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,660
actually

169
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:06,980
very

170
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,480
sophisticated.

171
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:07,880
It's

172
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,000
a

173
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,360

175
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:09,620
Hence,

176
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:09,860
there's

177
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:09,980
a

178
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,180
reason

179
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,400

Really,

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,540
photography

218
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:26,840
in

219
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,680
photojournalism,

220
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,000
and

221
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,280
the

222
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,480
reason

223
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,680
why

224
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:28,820
I

225
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,020
also

226
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,320
teach

227
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,060
photojournalism

228
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,240
is

229
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,460
because

230
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:30,620
I

231
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:30,880
believe

232
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,120
that's

233
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,260
the

234
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:31,600
basis

235
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,100
of

236
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,720
understanding

237
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:32,940
the

238
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,160
visual

239
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,640
language.

240
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,320
We

241
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,520
have

242
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:34,620
to

243
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:34,800
also

244
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,200
understand

245
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,420
how

246
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:35,560
do

247
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:35,640
we

248
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:35,800
use

249
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:35,900
the

250
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,100
visual

251
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,440
language

252
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:36,680
to

253
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:36,860
tell

254
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:36,960
a

255
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,120
very

256
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,500
specific

257
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,040
story.

258
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:38,600
And

259
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:38,760
at

260
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,020
some

261
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,400
point,

262
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:39,700
you

263
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:39,840
know,

264
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,060
what

265
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,260
ended

266
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,420
up

267
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:40,800
happening

268
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,140
is

269
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,480
that

270
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:41,880
I

271
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,040
knew

272
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,180
that

273
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,760
photojournalism

274
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:42,920
was

275
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,080
not

276
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,220
going

277
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,280
to

278
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,400
be

279
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,660
enough

280
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:43,840
for

281
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:43,980
the

282
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,180
things

283
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,320
that

284
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,420
I

285
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,600
wanted

286
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:44,800
to

287
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,040
speak

288
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,300
on,

289
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:45,840
and

290
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,000
this

291
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,120
is

292
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,240
how

293
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,360
I

294
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,600
entered

295
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:46,800
into

296
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:46,980
the

297
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,200
fine

298
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,360
art

299
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,780
world.

300
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,760
As

301
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:48,940
she

302
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,380
transitioned

303
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,640
to

304
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:49,920
fine

305
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,240
arts,

306
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:50,920
the

307
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,240
urge

308
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,420
to

309
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,700
change

310
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:51,840
the

311
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,260
world's

312
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,580
negative

313
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,100
perceptions

314
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,420
about

315
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:53,780
Africa

316
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,360
got

317
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,820
stronger.

318
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,060
The

319
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,420
images

320
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,620
that

321
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:56,740
I

322
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:56,940
saw

323
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,060
of

324
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,180
my

325
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,440
country,

326
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,880
Ethiopia,

327
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,800
was

328
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,200
always

329
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,100
showcasing

330
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,460
things

331
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:00,720
that

332
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,020
didn't

333
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,240
really

334
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,540
match

335
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:01,740
the

336
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,000
stories

337
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,140
that

338
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,280
my

339
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,460
mother

340
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:02,660
was

341
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:02,920
telling

342
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,180
me.

343
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,480
When

344
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:03,620
we

345
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:03,780
look

346
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:03,980
at

347
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,380
images,

348
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:04,760
especially

349
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,960
in

350
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,180

351
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,560

352
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:05,880
in

353
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,100
print

354
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,500
media,

355
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,020
often

356
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,539
when

357
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,539
there's

358
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:09,639
a

359
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,020
representation

360
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,380
of

361
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,500
the

362
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:10,900
continent,

363
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,720
it's

364
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:11,920
always

365
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,080
a

366
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,300

367
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,500
-sided

368
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,000
story.

369
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,580
So

370
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:13,800
at

371
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:13,900
a

372
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,040

373
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,380
early

374
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:14,800
age,

375
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,040
you

376
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,100
know,

377
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,260
my

378
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:15,500
first

379
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:15,800
exhibition

380
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,080
was

381
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,220
at

382
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,360
the

383
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,460
age

384
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:16,580
of

385
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,020
19,

386
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,680
and

387
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:17,780
I

388
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:17,880
had

389
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:17,960
a

390
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,120
very

391
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,500
specific

392
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,000
mission

393
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,540
on

394
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:19,900
how

395
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,160
do

396
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,300
we

397
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,000
reimagine

398
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,860
what

399
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,040
does

400
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,340
Africa

401
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,640
look

402
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:22,820
like,

403
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:22,960
what

404
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,080
is

405
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,200
the

406
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,600
culture,

407
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,280
you

408
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,320
know,

409
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,440
what

410
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:24,520
is

411
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:24,640
the

412
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,020
contemporary

413
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,600
story

414
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:25,900
of

415
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,040
the

416
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,420
continent?

417
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,160
And

418
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,300
this

419
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,440
has

420
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,560
been

421
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:27,740
one

422
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:27,820
of

423
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,960
the

424
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,260
reasons

425
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,780
that,

426
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,060
you

427
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,100
know,

428
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,220
I

429
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,380
moved

430
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,600

think

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:13,250
we

make

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:13,990
every

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,370
only

744
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:15,570
to

745
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,130
fantasize

746
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,350
about

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:16,589
going

750
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,209

751
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:17,350
to

752
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:17,490

to

757
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:18,750
really

758
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,209
work

759
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,290
within

761
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:20,950

really

767
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:22,750
going

there's

776
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:25,650

777
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:25,790
much

778
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:25,910
